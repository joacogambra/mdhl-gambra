            <p>
                The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a
                member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside
                neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                parents and previous league members
